### Implementation of Gaussian Distribution, Mean, Median, and Mode
This project focuses on understanding fundamental statistical concepts such as Gaussian (Normal) Distribution, Mean, Median, and Mode using Python.
The notebook demonstrates how these measures describe data distribution and central tendency through both numerical computation and visualization.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to:
- Explain central tendency measures (mean, median, mode)
- Visualize data distribution using Gaussian distribution
- Understand how data symmetry and skewness affect statistical measures
- Build a strong foundation for data analysis and machine learning preprocessing
