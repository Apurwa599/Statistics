### Implementation of Gaussian Distribution, Mean, Median, and Mode
This project focuses on understanding fundamental statistical concepts such as Gaussian (Normal) Distribution, Mean, Median, and Mode using Python.
The notebook demonstrates how these measures describe data distribution and central tendency through both numerical computation and visualization.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to:
- Explain central tendency measures (mean, median, mode)
- Visualize data distribution using Gaussian distribution
- Understand how data symmetry and skewness affect statistical measures
- Build a strong foundation for data analysis and machine learning preprocessing

## Methodology
1. Load and analyze the dataset
2. Calculate mean, median, and mode
3. Understand the relationship between these measures
4. Implement Gaussian distribution
5. Visualize the distribution using plots
6. Interpret the results based on data behaviorMethodology

## Statistical Concepts
- Mean: Measures the average value of the dataset
- Median: Identifies the middle value after sorting the data
- Mode: Determines the most frequently occurring value
- Gaussian Distribution: Represents a normal distribution where data is symmetrically distributed around the mean

## Visualization
Data visualization is performed to represent the Gaussian distribution. Plots help in understanding data spread, symmetry, and how mean, median,
and mode align in a normal distribution.

## Insights
- In a Gaussian distribution, mean, median, and mode are approximately equal
- Visualization helps detect skewness and data spread
- Understanding data distribution is critical before applying machine learning models

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how statistical measures and Gaussian distribution play a crucial role in data understanding. Visual and numerical analysis of mean, median, and mode helps in making informed decisions during data preprocessing and model selection.
